ðŸŒ‰ I'm someone who loves bridging the gap between people and AI. I believe that AI has the potential to make peopleâ€™s lives better in meaningful ways. Beyond just improving performance, I think itâ€™s crucial to create AI systems that are trustworthy, ethical, and responsible, while ensuring that AI evolves in this direction. I want to contribute to creating AI systems that understand and support people.
