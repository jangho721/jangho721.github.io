Hi, I’m <strong style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew</strong>, a Data Scientist with a passion for building AI systems to support data-driven decision-making, focusing on human-centered AI development.

I received M.S. in Artificial Intelligence at Hanyang University, advised by Dr. [Eunok Paek](https://bislab.hanyang.ac.kr/index.php?mid=Professor). My research applied ML to bioinformatics to address challenges in proteomics. Specifically, I focused on reranking and rescoring <em>de novo</em> sequencing results, and developed novel post-processing methods for accurate peptide identification.

Currently, I’m working as a Data Scientist at Ailys, building a Decision Intelligence Platform. Before joining Ailys, I worked at TmaxEduAI as an AI Engineer, where I developed AI-based systems for personalized learning.

I’m broadly interested in <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and <strong>Software Engineering</strong>, especially applying ML across diverse fields to explore solutions to real-world challenges. I focus on pushing the frontiers of AI by enabling new capabilities and achieving performance breakthroughs. I aim to build AI systems that act as intelligent assistants, understanding human needs and context to create actionable insights and deliver real value.

<span style="color: red;">I'm currently seeking a full-time position as a <strong style="color: red;">Data Scientist</strong> or <strong style="color: red;">Machine Learning Engineer</strong>. Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate!</span>
