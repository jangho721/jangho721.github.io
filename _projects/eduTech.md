    <p>
      This project is to <strong>quantify students' understanding of knowledge</strong>, which is used in dashboards and for providing educational content tailored to students' levels. For this, I developed several deep knowledge tracing models based on past learning histories.WAPLMATH Mathematics Deep Knowledge Tracing<br>Developing RESTful APIs for neural translation services.

    <h3 class="mb-4">Why Deep Knowledge Tracing?</h3>
    <p>
      "<strong>Understanding</strong>" is a subjective metric, so directly modeling it is a challenging task. Moreover, it is influenced by multiple concepts, not just a single one, making it difficult to estimate through simple calculations. Therefore, we model and indirectly estimate "understanding" by defining the probability of correctly answering the next question as an understanding of specific concepts, based on their problem-solving history (correct/incorrect answers). To achieve this, we use <strong>Deep Knowledge Tracing</strong> models based on <i>RNN</i>, <i>Attention Mechanism</i>, and <i>Transformer</i>, which effectively handle continuous problem-solving data to estimate "understanding".

    <p>
      This project is to <strong>quantify students' understanding of knowledge</strong>, which is used in dashboards and for recommending problems by level. For this, I developed several deep knowledge tracing models based on past learning histories and identified meaningful features for learning.

    <p>
      I developed a model with an <strong>AUC</strong> of <strong>88%</strong> using the problem-solving histories of <i>700+ middle school students</i>.
