🌉 I’m someone who loves bridging the gap between people and AI. I believe AI has the potential to make people’s lives better in meaningful ways, and I enjoy tackling complex problems, simplifying them, and uncovering insights from data. I’m especially interested in how AI can make a real-world impact across domains like business, science, and social good.

🧠 I’m also passionate about enhancing AI’s understanding and reasoning abilities, so that AI can interact and collaborate with human intuition to create greater synergy. I believe AI should continuously amplify human capabilities and evolve in a direction that benefits people, and I hope to contribute to that journey. Beyond just improving performance, I think it’s crucial to create AI systems that are trustworthy, ethical, and responsible, ensuring they evolve to better understand and support people.

🚀 Ultimately, my goal is to build AI systems that can better assist people, like JARVIS from Iron Man or TARS from Interstellar. I believe AI should not merely exist as technology, but serve as a partner that collaborates with humans and brings about meaningful change.

🧑‍🔬 I’ve been fortunate to collaborate with brilliant engineers, researchers, and scientists, learning so much from them. Working across diverse domains has broadened my perspective, and I enjoy discussing how AI impacts society. I constantly think about how to build safer, more responsible, and human-centered AI systems.

✨ Outside of work, I love traveling, sharing great food with good people, and recharging through sports and music. Listening to other people’s stories brings me energy and inspiration.

🌸 And one day, I hope my life can be a small source of hope to someone. Even though I work with technology, I want to remain warm, human, and be a spring-like presence in someone’s life.
