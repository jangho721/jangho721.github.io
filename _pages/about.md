Hello! I'm <strong style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew</strong>, an AI Engineer at TmaxEduAI, developing AI-based educational solutions for personalized learning, focusing on Knowledge Tracing and Recommendation Systems.

I received M.S. in Artificial Intelligence at Hanyang University, advised by Dr. [Eunok Paek](http://bislab.hanyang.ac.kr/index.php?mid=Professor). My research bridged machine learning and bioinformatics to address challenges in proteomics. Specifically, the focus of my work was reranking and rescoring <em>de novo</em> sequencing results, and I developed novel post-processing methods for accurate peptide identification.

I’m broadly interested in <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and <strong>Software Engineering</strong>, with a particular passion for building AI systems that solve real-world problems. I’m especially interested in contributing to pushing the frontiers of artificial intelligence by enabling new capabilities, achieving performance breakthroughs, while also creating data-driven scientific strategies for decision-making.

<span style="color: red;">I'm currently seeking a full-time position as a <strong style="color: red;">Data Scientist</strong> or <strong style="color: red;">Machine Learning Engineer</strong> starting in 2025. Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate!</span>
