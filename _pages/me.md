I'm a Research Engineer developing AI models for real-world applications, tackling unexpected challenges, and continuously improving model performance through experiments to advance services.

I'm passionate about creating AI systems that make an impact on business, science, and social good, and also uncovering insights and patterns from complex data to support decision-making.

I'm someone who enjoys discussing the societal impact of AI technologies and constantly reflects on how to develop trustworthy, safe, ethical, and responsible AI systems.

Ultimately, I aim to develop <u>agentic AI</u> that can better assist people and address gaps in society by improving computers' perception, understanding, and reasoning.

I'm a Machine Learning Researcher/Engineer, focusing on ML interpretability and human-centered AI development.

After completing my PhD, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at Stripe, where I extended my interests in building AI models for safety and security. At Stripe, I developed advanced ML models to detect potential fraud in high-stakes financial environments, gaining valuable experience in handling adversarial transaction patterns.

I have been fortunate to work with amazing researchers, engineers, and scientists at Stripe, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Intel.

My PhD research focused on making ML models more interpretable, trustworthy, and safe, by bridging the gap between complex deep neural networks (DNNs) and intuitive human understanding.

Developed and enhanced ML models for detecting fraud transactions.
Investigated and resolved degraded performance in a fraud detection model by redesigning an unrealistic labeling strategy, improving prediction performance.
Applied transfer learning in a fraud dispute prediction model and optimized performance for specific target regions.
Streamlined the training data generation processes on Stripe's ML pipeline, accelerating experimentation across Stripe's ML ecosystem.

Designed and implemented a deep neural network for detecting fraud transactions, highlighted in this blog. The model's advanced design reduced the time to train our model by over 85% (to less than two hours), significantly increasing the volume of fraud transcations detected.

We introduced Zorak, an AI-driven community tool designed to significantly reduce tradersâ€™ manual workloads and contribute to traders community building. Our AI agent, Zorara, analyzes real-time market data and provides actionable trade insights, empowering traders to make informed decisions quickly and efficiently.

Hello! I'm <strong style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew</strong>, an AI Engineer at TmaxEduAI, developing AI-based educational solutions for personalized learning, focusing on Knowledge Tracing and Recommendation Systems.

My research bridged machine learning and bioinformatics to address challenges in proteomics. Specifically, the focus of my work was reranking and rescoring de novo sequencing results, and I developed novel post-processing methods for accurate peptide identification.
