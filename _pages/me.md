✨ I’m someone who loves bridging the gap between people and AI. I believe AI has the potential to make people’s lives better in meaningful ways, and I enjoy tackling complex problems, simplifying them, and uncovering insights from data. I’m especially interested in how AI can make a real-world impact across domains like business, science, and social good, and I constantly think about how to build safer, more responsible, and human-centered AI systems.

🤖 I’m also passionate about enhancing AI’s understanding and reasoning abilities, so that AI can interact and collaborate with human intuition to create greater synergy. I believe AI should continuously amplify human capabilities and evolve in a direction that benefits people, and I hope to contribute to that journey. Beyond just improving performance, I think it’s crucial to create AI systems that are trustworthy, ethical, and responsible, ensuring they evolve to better understand and support people.

🚀 Ultimately, my goal is to build AI systems that can better assist people, like JARVIS from Iron Man or TARS from Interstellar. I believe AI should not merely exist as technology, but serve as a partner that collaborates with humans and brings about meaningful change.

🧑‍🔬 I’ve been fortunate to collaborate with brilliant engineers, researchers, and scientists, sharing knowledge and experiences, growing together, and enjoying conversations about how AI impacts society. Working across diverse domains has broadened my perspective, and I’ve learned so much throughout this journey.

🌱 Outside of work, I love traveling, sharing good food with great people, and recharging through sports and music. I enjoy listening to other people’s stories and also find joy in experiencing new things, which bring me a lot of inspiration and lessons. I draw energy from the small moments of luck and kindness in my daily life.

🌸 And one day, I hope my life can be a small source of hope to someone. Even though I work with technology, I want to remain warm, human, and be a spring-like presence in someone’s life.
