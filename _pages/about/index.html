My research applied ML to bioinformatics to address challenges in proteomics. Specifically, I focused on reranking and rescoring <em>de novo</em> sequencing results, and developed novel post-processing methods for accurate peptide identification.</p> <p>Currently, I’m working as a Data Scientist at Ailys, building a Decision Intelligence Platform. Before joining Ailys, I worked at TmaxEduAI as an AI Engineer, where I developed AI-based systems for personalized learning.</p> <p>I’m broadly interested in <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and <strong>Software Engineering</strong>, especially applying ML across diverse domains. I focus on building AI systems that assist humans by understanding their needs and context, delivering value. I aim to push the frontiers of AI by enabling new capabilities, achieving performance breakthroughs, and creating data-driven insights.</p> <p><span style="color: red;">I’m currently seeking a full-time position as a <strong style="color: red;">Data Scientist</strong> or <strong style="color: red;">Machine Learning Engineer</strong>.
